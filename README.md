# 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Berry

Senior software architect & engineer working on **regulated medical device software**, data pipelines, and developer platforms.

I design and build **compliant, production-grade systems** at the intersection of:
- medical devices (IEC 62304, ISO 13485, CSV)
- cloud infrastructure (AWS)
- modern Python & web stacks

Currently based in France 🇫🇷, originally from England 🇬🇧.

## 🩺 Current focus

### Medical devices & health tech
- Backend architectures for sensor-driven medical devices (ECG / signal processing pipelines)
- Data ingestion, storage, validation, and traceability (S3-centric data lakes, metadata databases)
- Strong emphasis on **auditability, validation, and risk management**

### Regulated software engineering
- Software lifecycle documentation (SADS, HLRA, CSV)
- Tooling aligned with IEC 62304, ISO 13485, and GxP-style expectations
- SBOMs, license compliance, static analysis, and reproducible builds

### Developer platforms
- Internal engineering templates (Python, React/TypeScript)
- Contract-first APIs (OpenAPI)
- CI/CD pipelines that double as validation evidence

## 🛠️ Tech stack (opinionated, battle-tested)

**Languages**
- Python (primary)
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- SQL

**Backend**
- FastAPI, Flask, Django
- Async APIs, background workers, batch jobs
- OpenAPI-driven design

**Frontend**
- React + TypeScript
- Storybook, MSW, contract-based mocks
- Visual & contract regression testing

**Cloud & DevOps**
- AWS (S3, IAM, EC2, Batch, RDS, SNS, SSM)
- Terraform (multi-environment, compliance-tagged infrastructure)
- GitHub Actions, OIDC, artifact pipelines

**Quality & security**
- Static analysis (Bandit, Semgrep, Ruff, Mypy)
- SBOMs (CycloneDX), license checks
- Traceability & validation artifacts

---

## 📐 How I work

- Architecture-first, but pragmatic
- Prefer boring, explicit solutions over clever ones
- Strong bias toward **maintainability, traceability, and failure modes**
- Comfortable operating as engineer, architect, and bridge between engineering, compliance, and product

## 🌱 Outside of work

- Long-term investing & financial modeling
- Tabletop gaming & miniature painting
- Raising kids, growing tomatoes, keeping chickens 🐔
