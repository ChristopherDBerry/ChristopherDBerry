### Hi there 👋

For professional queries please see my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-berry-346442253/)

I'm Chris from England, living in France raising my next iteration 🧒🧒🧒 (plus tomatoes 🍅 and a few chickens 🐔).

I do Python-flavored full stack development. Web Accessibility evangelist (I have read the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) more times than you). 

Currently working with PlayMakers making tools to empower gamers to make their own video game content, which is quite a lot of fun.

Some of my main skills are

- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Node.js
- SQL

- React
- HTML / CSS
- AWS
