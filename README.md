### Hi there 👋

For professional queries please see my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-berry-346442253/)

I'm Chris from England, currently living in France raising tomatoes 🍅 and chickens 🐔.

I do full stack development, with a passion for web accessibility (I have read [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) more times than you). Some of my main skills are

- Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Node.js
- SQL
- Javascript
- React
- HTML / CSS
- AWS

When I am being less serious I also muck about developing my own AI tools, playing with blockchains and obsessing over JR Tolkien 💍🧙🧒🧒🧒🧒👨👨🧔🧝.

It's looking a little quiet quiet around here 😴. I'm working on it.
